# Publish and restore

## Publish during the requested fit

Inputs: a confirmed `model_plan`, `training_table` and its compatible `snapshot`, plus a
Snowflake connector scoped to the selected registry database/schema. Choose a new explicit
model version. Check the destination and privileges first; do not overwrite an existing
version or silently let the registry choose its default on reload.

```python
import kumo.engine as kumo

location = kumo.ModelRegistryLocation(model_name=MODEL_NAME, version=MODEL_VERSION)
trainer = kumo.Trainer(model_plan)
training_result = trainer.fit(
    training_table, snapshot=snapshot,
    export_config=kumo.ModelOutputConfig(connector=registry_connector, location=location),
)
published = training_result.published_model
if published is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Fit returned no publication record")
print(published.name, published.version)
```

Record the returned name/version, registry database/schema, query, graph-building code,
column/key/time metadata, source scope, package versions and intended evaluation protocol.
Keep credentials outside this record. `ModelOutputConfig` accepts exactly one of `path` or
`location`; Snowflake uses `location`, not `path`. Do not run a second fit just to inspect or
retrieve an existing publication. An exception during publication is not evidence training
never ran; inspect retained results before any retry.

## Restore and prepare scoring inputs

```python
loaded = kumo.Trainer.load_from_connector(
    registry_connector,
    location=kumo.ModelRegistryLocation(model_name=MODEL_NAME, version=MODEL_VERSION),
)
```

For an explicitly retained complete local bundle, use this alternative:

```python
loaded = kumo.Trainer.load(RETAINED_BUNDLE_DIRECTORY)
```

Load only trusted publications. The loader checks bundle integrity and training metadata;
hashes detect corruption, not publisher trust. Missing `training-spec.json`, incompatible
spec versions or failed integrity checks are actionable restore errors. Retrieve the complete
correct bundle; do not fabricate metadata or bypass validation.

Reconstruct the Snowflake sources, immutable Tables, keys/types/time columns and Edges from
the recorded graph definition, then materialize `graph.snapshot()`. Preserve compatible
feature schema, topology, entity/target contract and encodings. New scoring data is possible;
an old snapshot ID is provenance, not a substitute for current compatible graph data. Do not
force compatibility by editing bundle internals.

With that reconstructed `graph` and recorded `TRAINED_QUERY`, and a user-selected naive UTC
`SCORING_TIME` for a temporal query:

```python
pq = kumo.PredictiveQuery(graph=graph, query=TRAINED_QUERY)
pq.validate()
print(pq.get_task_type())
snapshot = graph.snapshot()
population = pq.generate_prediction_table(
    snapshot, prediction_time=SCORING_TIME,
    plan=loaded.training_table_generation_plan,
)
# This example is binary classification; preserve the chosen threshold.
scores = loaded.predict(
    population, snapshot=snapshot, binary_classification_threshold=THRESHOLD,
)
print(scores.num_rows, scores.files)
```

For static queries omit `prediction_time`; for other tasks use their supported scoring
arguments in [task journeys](../../kumoai-reference/references/task_journeys.md). Forecast scoring must
reuse `loaded.training_table_generation_plan`. Exact populations use
`PredictionTable.from_source_table`, not an entity filter silently replacing supplied rows.
The loader restores model state; scoring still needs explicit population and snapshot.

## What survives publication

| Content | Lifetime and retrieval |
| --- | --- |
| Selected checkpoint, encoders/target encoder, trainer config and resolved plan | Complete portable bundle |
| Graph/task/input manifests, metrics, prediction schema, training specification | Bundle metadata, not source rows or graph storage |
| Graph index, staged source export, generated training and scoring tables | Separate local working state; recreate or explicitly retain as appropriate |
| Per-trial results, epoch histories, progress, attribution and column analysis | Separate run files; retain selected diagnostics before session teardown |
| Predictions and embeddings | Separate selected Parquet outputs or explicit Snowflake writes |

A bundle alone cannot provide absent histories or explanation files. Local scratch paths
are disposable unless their storage lifetime has been established. Keep retention separate
from a reusable index cache, which can be rebuilt and is not a portable model bundle.
