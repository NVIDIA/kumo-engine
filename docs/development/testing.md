# Testing

Depending on the behavior changed, run the relevant checks below. A passing
local check does not establish a supported deployment or GPU profile.

| Tier | Examples | Prerequisites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation | [Reference, agent, and catalog checks](../maintenance/README.md#validation) | Python 3; Bash and standard shell tools |
| Focused Python | `.venv/bin/pytest path/to/test.py -k test_name`; package-local tests | Matching installed environment and test dependencies |
| Lint and types | `.venv/bin/flake8 <path>`, `.venv/bin/isort --check <path>`, `.venv/bin/pyright -p pyrightconfig.json` | `uv sync --extra dev --extra cpu` (or `--extra cu130` for GPU) environment |
| UI | `npm --prefix ui run test -- --run <test-path>`, `npm --prefix ui run type-check` | Installed UI and in-tree catalog dependencies |
| Catalog | `npm --prefix packages/kumo-ui-catalog run test:ci` | Catalog dependencies and configured Playwright browser |
| Rust | `cargo test --manifest-path packages/diskgraph/Cargo.toml -p diskgraph-train-table` | Rust toolchain, native build prerequisites, and crate dependencies |
| Helm contract | [Helm CI checks](../../.github/workflows/kumo-helm-ci.yml) | Helm, Python, and each check's declared tooling |
| Integration/GPU | `make test-kumo-core-gpu` for CUDA behavior; selected storage, training, or deployment tests | CUDA-capable GPU with matching PyTorch/CUDA/Faiss dependencies for GPU tests; explicit services, data, and credentials where required |

Shared test setup loads Snowflake credentials only when a selected test requests
them. Live Snowflake tests still need credentials and access to the service.
In `test` and `dev_local` deployment modes, instance discovery uses the hostname
without querying the EC2 metadata service.

Run from the repository root unless a component guide says otherwise.
Python package test suites have different roots and fixtures; inspect the
package's configuration before invoking pytest over multiple packages.

kumo-engine and kumo-core tests load the DiskGraph native module
(`diskgraph/_c.abi3.so`) and its `bin/ingest` binary from the installed
`diskgraph` package. Both must be built from the same tree as the Python code
under test: a build from an older checkout fails with missing attributes or
arguments (for example `RuntimeIndex.iter(projections=...)` or
`compute_col_stats_for_parquet(percentiles=...)`). After pulling DiskGraph
changes, rebuild with `make install-diskgraph`, which builds and installs both.

For connector changes, start with the [public test command](public-tests.md).
It builds its prerequisites and runs without cloud credentials. The
[test matrix](../connector-test-matrix.md) lists coverage and CI limits.

## Report evidence

Record the command, environment, result, and any untested dependency. Keep
credentials, customer data, and private logs out of committed test reports.
For a behavior change, add a regression test at the relevant boundary; pure
prose edits need reference checks and a factual review rather than tests that
repeat the prose.
